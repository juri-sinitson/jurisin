# Jurisin 

## Running the app
Before you run the app first time, you need to run `yarn run install`.
Run `yarn run artworks-backend-local` to start the local server and run `yarn run start` to start the app.

## What does the app `artwork` do?
The app fetches artworks in a grid list. When an element of that list is clicked/tipped the details dialog of the artwork is opened.
The artworks API is described on https://api.artic.edu/docs/.
The goal of the app is to demonstrate the usage of
1. Monorepo concept (see https://nx.dev/l/r/core-concepts/why-monorepos) and below
2. Storybook, see below
3. Request caching with @ngrx/data, see below
4. Unit-Testing by testing behavior instead of implementation details (see also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM)

## Testing
Run `yarn run test`

## Deployment
Run `yarn run build` and serve or copy the directory `dist/apps/artwork`. If you reset the container with every deployment, you also need to run `yarn run install` every time before the building command.

The app `artwork` uses relative paths which are proxyed to the local backend (see `apps/artwork/src/server/backend/backend-local.js`) during development. See also the configuration in `apps/artwork/src/proxy.conf.json` and https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server. Thus we avoid CORS-Problems of the browser. For production you have to rewrite/proxy the paths above  probably in similar way to this is done in the proxy configuration above.

In the production you have to proxy the relative path `/api/artworks/` to `https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks`production URL. And the relative path `/images/:identifier` has to be proxied to one of the paths on listed on https://api.artic.edu/docs/#image-sizes, e.g. for the the size 400 you have to proxy to the production URL `https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg`.

## Tooling
### nx
See https://nx.dev/l/r/core-concepts/why-monorepos, https://nx.dev/l/r/core-extended/computation-caching
and the DDD principles on https://www.angulararchitects.io/book pages 17 to 22.

### PrimeNG
This UI library is used to avoid writing UI-boilerplate-code. It includes the library Primeflex (similar to Tailwindcss) with utility classes (e.g. `w-full`, `lg:w-8`) for responsive design.
### Storybook
Storybook is a kind of catalog of UI-Components and can be used as an interface between developers and non-developers. The catalog is maintained by developers that non-developers are able to checkout every state of the component (e.g. primary, loading or error). A non-developer can also experiment with e.g. extreme long text in the title to check out responsive behavior.

#### Commands
Run `nx run artwork-feature:storybook` to see the UI-Components of the library `artwork-feature`.
Run `nx run shared-ui-common:storybook` to see the common UI-Components of the library `shared-ui-common`.
Run `nx clear-cache` if you notice that storybook does not reflect the library changes an says it cannot resolve a library.

### @ngrx/data
Used for management of data fetched from network, e.g. via http. The data is fetched once and every component needing that data accesses it independently using the appropriate service.

## TODOs
### Storybook
1. Storybook: limit the canvas size to avoid every component to take the whole screen.

### Deprecations
Bump up RxJs and import everything from `rxjs` instead of `rxjs/operators`.
### Dedup
1. Use the local backend data for storybook like this `import { data } from 'libs/artwork/api/src/assets/artworks.json';` instead of copy-paste.
### Deployment
1. Figure out how to access the API (currently https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks) using 
backend. The URL works in the browser, so probably some headers are missing.
Thus you may try to copy all the headers from the browser that there is no difference
between the browser an the local backend request. You may also try to make a request
in postman or similar software first.
4. Figure out how to proxy the relative image paths in storybook. The proxy configuration for default app is not applied to storybook automatically. Most probably you need to extend the webpack configuration of storybook, see https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/webpack.

### Testing
1. Add E2E (e.g. Cypress) tests using cypress which tests the app in productive mode or in the one similar to productive.
2. Test filtering of images. It currently does not seem to work in jest. So you probably have to do it with E2E (e.g. Cypress) instead.
2. Figure out why http error is shown when testing manually or when mocking getError of the `ArtwokService`, but not when mocking the http-request like this:
```typescript
    httpMock.expectOne((req: HttpRequest<unknown>): boolean => {
      return req.url.includes('api/artworks');
    }).flush('Error', {status: 500, statusText: 'Artworks load error!'});    
```
Alternatively use E2E (e.g. Cypress) for this.
3. Figure out how to merge code coverage or how to show code coverage over multiple libraries.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@jurisin/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
